### Core Components

#### 1. Bot Initialization (Bot.java)
- Loads environment variables for API keys and configuration
- Establishes database connection
- Registers all Discord slash commands
- Initializes event schedulers for:
  - Name updates (every 2 hours)
  - Clan Games tracking (22nd-28th monthly)
  - Season wins tracking (start/end of season)
  - Listening events polling (every 2 minutes)

#### 2. Command Handlers
Each command is implemented as a separate class extending `ListenerAdapter`:
- `onSlashCommandInteraction()`: Handles command execution
- `onCommandAutoCompleteInteraction()`: Provides autocomplete suggestions
- `onModalInteraction()`: Handles modal form submissions
- `onButtonInteraction()`: Handles button clicks

#### 3. Data Wrappers
Encapsulate both database and API data:
- **Lazy Loading**: Data fetched only when needed
- **Caching**: Results cached until `refreshData()` called
- **Dual Sources**: Database (DB) and API data available separately
- **Type Safety**: Strong typing with enums for roles, types, etc.

#### 4. Event Scheduling System
Three separate schedulers:
- **schedulernames**: Updates player names from API
- **schedulertasks**: Runs automated tasks (Clan Games, Wins, Events)
- **Event Polling**: Unified system checking all events every 2 minutes

- Event polling reduced to 2-minute intervals to minimize requests

**Error Handling**:
- Network errors: Retry with backoff
- 404 errors: Player/clan doesn't exist
- 403 errors: Private war log or invalid API key
- 503 errors: API maintenance, retry later

### Google Gemini AI API

**Purpose**: Powers the `/lmagent` command for AI assistance

**Integration**: google-genai SDK 1.22.0

**Authentication**: Via `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY` environment variable

**Context**: Loaded from `lost_manager/context.txt` file (system instructions)

**Usage Pattern**:
1. User provides prompt via `/lmagent` command
2. Bot sends prompt with context to Gemini API
3. Response returned to Discord channel

---

## Event System

### Scheduler Architecture

The bot uses Java's `ScheduledExecutorService` with three separate schedulers:

#### 1. Name Updates Scheduler (`schedulernames`)
- **Frequency**: Every 2 hours
- **Purpose**: Keep player names synchronized with CoC API
- **Process**:
  ```
  For each player in database:
    Fetch name from CoC API
    Update database if changed
  ```

#### 2. Tasks Scheduler (`schedulertasks`)
- **Purpose**: Runs all automated tasks and events
- **Tasks**:
  1. Clan Games tracking (start/end)
  2. Season wins tracking (start/end)
  3. Listening events polling
  4. Individual event executions

#### 3. Event Polling System
- **Frequency**: Every 2 minutes
- **Purpose**: Check all listening events and schedule upcoming ones
- **Process**:
  ```
  Every 2 minutes:
    Query all listening_events from database
    For each event:
      Calculate fire timestamp
      If within 5 minutes and not scheduled:
        Schedule event execution
      If overdue:
        Mark as scheduled (skip to prevent duplicates)
    
    For CW start events (duration = -1):
      Check clan war state
      If war just started:
        Fire all start events for clan
        Update clan state
      If war ended:
        Clear fired events tracker
  ```

### Event Types and Timing

#### Clan Games (CS)
- **Start**: 22nd of month at 7:00 AM (hardcoded)
- **End**: 28th of month at 12:00 PM (hardcoded)
- **Data Collection**: Snapshots taken at start and end
- **Fire Time**: Calculated from `getNext28thAt1pm()` minus duration
- **Validation**: Compares achievement_data for CLANGAMES_POINTS

**Example**:
```java
duration = 0 // Fire at end
fire_time = getNext28thAt1pm() - 0 = 28th at 1:00 PM
// (1 hour buffer after end for API propagation)
```

#### Clan War (CW)
- **Detection**: Queries `/currentwar` endpoint
- **Start Detection**: State changes from "notInWar"/"warEnded" to "preparation"/"inWar"
- **End Time**: From API `endTime` field
- **Fire Time**: 
  - `duration = -1` (start): Fires when war starts (state change detection)
  - `duration = 0` (end): Fires at war end
  - `duration = N`: Fires N milliseconds before war end
- **Validation**: Checks `isCWActive()` before firing

**Example**:
```java
// End event
duration = 0
fire_time = war.endTime - 0 = exactly at war end

// 1 hour before end
duration = 3600000
fire_time = war.endTime - 3600000 = 1 hour before end

// Start event
duration = -1
fire_time = triggered by state change detection
```

#### CWL Day (CWLDAY)
- **Detection**: Queries `/currentwar/leaguegroup`
- **Day End Time**: Each war day has individual end time
- **Fire Time**: Calculated from current CWL war end time minus duration
- **Validation**: Checks `isCWLActive()` before firing

**Example**:
```java
duration = 0
fire_time = cwl_day.endTime - 0 = at day end
```

#### Raid Weekend (RAID)
- **Detection**: Queries `/capitalraidseasons`
- **Start**: Friday at specific time (from API)
- **End**: Monday at specific time (from API)
- **Fire Time**: Calculated from raid end time minus duration
- **Validation**: Checks `RaidActive()` before firing

**Example**:
```java
duration = 0
fire_time = raid.endTime - 0 = at raid end
```

### Event Actions

When an event fires, the action type determines what happens:

#### INFOMESSAGE
- Sends informational message to channel
- Lists violations/status
- No automated actions

#### KICKPOINT
- Sends message listing violations
- Automatically adds kickpoints to violators
- Uses kickpoint reason from actionvalues
- Respects kickpoint expiration settings

#### CWDONATOR
- Randomly selects war donors
- Can use list-based rotation (tracks previous selections)
- Can exclude leaders/co-leaders
- Number of donors based on war size

#### FILLER (CW only)
- Lists members opted out of war
- Used during preparation phase
- Helps with roster management

#### RAIDFAILS (Raid only)
- Analyzes district attack distribution
- Identifies over-attacked districts
- Lists all attackers or assigns kickpoints to worst offenders
- Configurable thresholds and tie-breaker logic

### Event Execution Flow

```
1. Event Polling (every 2 minutes)
   ↓
2. Calculate Fire Time
   ↓
3. Is fire time within 5 minutes? → Yes
   ↓                                   ↓ No
4. Schedule execution              4. Skip (check again next poll)
   ↓
5. Wait until fire time
   ↓
6. Execute Event (with retry logic)
   ↓
7. Validate Should Fire (check game state)
   ↓
8. Query CoC API
   ↓
9. Process Data Based on Event Type
   ↓
10. Build Discord Message
   ↓
11. Send to Channel
   ↓
12. Execute Actions (kickpoints, etc.)
   ↓
13. Log Success/Failure
```

**Retry Logic**:
- Max 3 retries with exponential backoff (5s, 10s, 20s)
- Validates event should still fire before each attempt
- Logs failures for debugging

### State Management

**CW Start Events**:
- Tracks last known war state per clan (in-memory)
- Detects state transitions (notInWar → preparation/inWar)
- Fires all start events for clan when transition detected
- Tracks fired events per war to prevent duplicates
- Clears fired tracker when war ends

**Event Scheduling**:
- Tracks scheduled event IDs to prevent duplicate scheduling
- Cleans up old scheduled events after 1 hour
- Skips overdue events on bot restart to prevent spam

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Required environment variables (loaded in `Bot.main()`):

```bash
# Discord
LOST_MANAGER_TOKEN=<Discord bot token>
DISCORD_GUILD_ID=<Discord server ID>
DISCORD_VERIFIED_ROLE_ID=<Role ID for verified members>
DISCORD_EX_MEMBER_ROLE_ID=<Role ID for ex-members>

# Database
LOST_MANAGER_DB_URL=<PostgreSQL connection URL>
LOST_MANAGER_DB_USER=<Database username>
LOST_MANAGER_DB_PASSWORD=<Database password>

# APIs
LOST_MANAGER_API_KEY=<Clash of Clans API key>
GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY=<Google Gemini API key>
```

### File Structure

```
lost_manager/
└── context.txt           # AI assistant context/instructions
```

**context.txt**: System instructions for the Google Gemini AI assistant. Defines the bot's behavior and knowledge when responding to `/lmagent` commands.

### Deployment

**Build**: Maven-based Java project
```bash
mvn clean package
```

**Run**:
```bash
java -jar target/lostcrmanager-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
```

**Dependencies** (from pom.xml):
- JDA 5.0.0-alpha.14 (Discord API)
- PostgreSQL 42.7.7 (Database driver)
- org.json 20230227 (JSON parsing)
- Jackson 2.15.2 (JSON serialization)
- google-genai 1.22.0 (AI integration)

### Database Initialization

On startup, the bot:
1. Checks database connection
2. Runs `dbutil.Connection.tablesExists()` to create missing tables
3. Applies schema updates from .sql files if needed

**Manual Schema Updates**:
- `achievement_data_schema.sql`: Achievement tracking
- `cw_fillers_table.sql`: War fillers tracking
- `cwdonator_lists_table.sql`: Donor rotation tracking
- `sideclans_table.sql`: Side clans for CWL

---

## Special Features

### Kickpoint Expiration
- Configurable per clan (e.g., 30 days)
- Set via `/clanconfig`
- Calculated as: `expires = date + expire_days`
- Expired kickpoints excluded from total
- Not automatically deleted (kept for records)

### Dual Data Sources
Many data wrappers maintain both database and API data:
- **Database**: Authoritative for clan membership and links
- **API**: Real-time game data (war status, achievements, etc.)
- **Synchronization**: `/memberstatus` command identifies mismatches

### Autocomplete
Commands with autocomplete use `onCommandAutoCompleteInteraction()`:
- **Clans**: Lists clans from database
- **Players**: Lists players (filtered by clan if applicable)
- **Roles**: Lists available clan roles
- **Reasons**: Lists kickpoint reasons for selected clan
- **Seasons**: Lists recent seasons for wins tracking

### Role Synchronization
- **Verified Role**: Assigned on first account link
- **Ex-Member Role**: Assigned on clan removal (if configured)
- **Clan Roles**: Can be configured per clan in `/clanconfig`
  - Leader, Co-Leader, Elder, Member roles
  - `/checkroles` verifies synchronization
  - Manual role assignment may be needed after promotions/demotions

### Name Updates
- Player names updated from API every 2 hours
- Prevents stale names in database
- Used for Discord nicknames and display

### Achievement Tracking
Historical snapshots saved for:
- **Clan Games Points**: Start (22nd) and end (28th) of each month
- **Wins**: Start and end of each season
- Used for `/wins` command and Clan Games event tracking
- Auto-cleanup after 6 months (see `achievement_data_schema.sql`)

---

## Error Handling

### Command Errors
All commands implement error handling with user-friendly messages:
- Missing parameters: "Der Parameter ist erforderlich!"
- Permission denied: "Du musst mindestens Vize-Anführer sein..."
- Not found: "Dieser Spieler existiert nicht..."
- API errors: "Fehler beim Abrufen der API-Daten"

### Database Errors
- Connection retry logic in `DBUtil`
- Duplicate key violations caught and reported
- Prepared statements prevent SQL injection

### API Errors
- Network timeouts: Retry with backoff
- Rate limiting: Queued with delays
- Invalid responses: Logged and skipped

### Event Execution Errors
- Validation before firing (checks game state)
- Retry logic (up to 3 attempts)
- Detailed error logging
- Graceful degradation (skip failed events)

---

## Permissions Model

### Bot Permissions
- Co-Leader or higher of any clan: Most management commands
- Leader only: `/clanconfig`, critical settings
- Admin role: Special commands like `/restart`

**Permission Check Pattern**:
```java
User user = new User(event.getUser().getId());
HashMap<String, Player.RoleType> roles = user.getClanRoles();
boolean hasPermission = false;
for (String clanTag : roles.keySet()) {
    RoleType role = roles.get(clanTag);
    if (role == LEADER || role == COLEADER || role == ADMIN) {
        hasPermission = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

### Discord Permissions
Some commands require Discord permissions:
- `/deletemessages`: Manage Messages
- `/reactionsrole`: Manage Roles
- Bot needs: Send Messages, Embed Links, Manage Nicknames, Manage Roles

---

## Logging and Monitoring

### Console Output
- Startup messages: Database connection, event initialization
- Scheduled task execution: "Es werden alle Clanspieldaten übertragen..."
- Event firing: "Executing event {id} (attempt {n})"
- Errors: Full stack traces to stderr

### Event Logging
- Event scheduling: "Scheduling event {id} to fire in {n} minutes"
- Event validation: "{Type} event validation: {result}"
- Event success: "Event {id} executed successfully"
- Event failure: "Event {id} failed after {n} attempts"

### Database Logging
Some tables include audit fields:
- `created_at`: Timestamp of creation
- `updated_at`: Timestamp of last update (where applicable)

---

## AI Integration Details

### Google Gemini Client
Initialized in `Bot.main()`:
```java
genaiClient = Client.builder()
    .apiKey(System.getenv("GOOGLE_GENAI_API_KEY"))
    .build();
```

### Context Loading
System instructions loaded from file:
```java
Path txtFile = jarDir.resolve("lost_manager").resolve("context.txt");
systemInstructions = Files.readString(txtFile);
```

### Usage in `/lmagent`
The command sends user prompts with system context to Gemini for responses. This allows for bot-specific knowledge and behavior customization.

## Maintenance Tasks

### Regular Maintenance
1. **Achievement Data Cleanup**: Run every 6 months
   ```sql
   SELECT cleanup_old_achievement_data();
   ```

2. **CW Fillers Cleanup**: Run weekly
   ```sql
   DELETE FROM cw_fillers WHERE war_end_time < NOW() - INTERVAL '14 days';
   ```

3. **Expired Kickpoints**: Not auto-deleted, but excluded from totals

### Monitoring
- Check console logs for errors
- Monitor API rate limits
- Verify event execution success rates
- Check database connection stability

### Backups
- Regular PostgreSQL backups recommended
- Critical tables: `players`, `clans`, `kickpoints`, `achievement_data`
